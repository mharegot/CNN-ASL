Give detailed instructions for how to run your code here.

As our code uses Keras, you have to enter an environment which contains all of
Keras's packages. Inputting the following statement in your terminal will place
you in said environment: source /usr/swat/bin/CS63env. Aside from that, running
our code is no different from running any python 3 code: python3 "python file".
Ensure that the training and testing data are in the same directory as our code
or the code will not be able to run. The files to run are the following:
Old_sign_language_CNN.py, and New_sign_language_CNN.py
